# reconnect - reconciliation tool built on Rust**

Reconciliation must be cheap and fast and inspired by the usage of Merkle trees by Cassandra for detecting anti-entropy, this is an attempt to use Merkle trees for performing quick and efficient reconciliation operations.  

This project has the following additives :

1. Code rewritten in Rust.  No GC and absolutely bare metal. 
2. Redesigned the Merkle Tree to be an array (like the heap array) instead of a first class datastucture (with Python), to optimize on locality.
3. Enhanced the code to support CSVs. Has abstractions to extend to other formats.
4. The currently implementation stores the hashes (32 bit) in memory.  However, the underlying data could be stored in an external store (database/file). Also, swapped Adler with murmur3 for speed.
5. Finally, the numbers.  1 million * 1 million compares in ~22 seconds. The code is single threaded and runs on a single machine.  Changing it to multi-threaded is a very quick change.  Can be sharded too but needs some work.


**Complexity:**

As against hash/tree based comparisons where the time complexity needs to be calculated based on input, this is an example of [output sensitive algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Output-sensitive_algorithm) where the complexity is Î˜(d), d being the number of leaf node differences.

**Rust experts**

Would greatly appreciate your feedback on idiomatic usage, best practices and optimizations.
